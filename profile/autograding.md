# Autograding

Autograding is a powerful tool that allows for the automatic assessment of code submissions. It not only streamlines the grading process but also provides immediate feedback to students. This document outlines how to set up and use autograding within the assignments in this organization.

### Setting Up Tests

Creating automated tests is the foundation of autograding. Here's how to set up tests for an assignment:

- **Define Test Cases:** Identify the specific cases you want to test (e.g., edge cases, common mistakes).
- **Write Test Scripts:** Use a testing framework compatible with the programming language to write test scripts.
- **Provide Expected Outputs:** Include the expected outputs for each test case.
- **Document the Tests:** Explain what each test is checking, so students understand what is being assessed.

### Using Autograding

Implementing autograding into assignments involves several steps:

- **Integrate with a Platform:** Use an autograding platform compatible with the organization's infrastructure.
- **Configure the Tests:** Set up the tests to run automatically upon submission.
- **Set Grading Criteria:** Define how the tests contribute to the overall grade (e.g., weight of each test).
- **Provide Feedback:** Configure the system to provide feedback on failed tests to help students understand their mistakes.
- **Review and Override if Necessary:** Allow for manual review and potential overriding of the autograded scores if human judgment is needed.

## Conclusion

Autograding enhances the learning experience by providing immediate and consistent feedback on code submissions. It also frees up instructors to focus on more complex assessments and personalized interactions with students.

Setting up and using autograding requires careful planning and consideration of the learning objectives. By following these guidelines, you can create an effective and efficient autograding system that supports both teaching and learning.
