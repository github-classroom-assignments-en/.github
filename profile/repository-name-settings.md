# Repository Name Settings

Proper naming and organization of repositories are essential for maintaining a coherent and navigable structure within the organization. This document outlines the guidelines for naming repositories and organizing them within specific categories or topics.

### Naming Conventions

Repository names should be clear, descriptive, and consistent. Follow these conventions:

- **Use Descriptive Names:** Choose names that accurately describe the content or purpose of the repository.
- **Follow a Standard Format:** If applicable, use a standard format across similar repositories (e.g., `topic-subtopic-assignment`).
- **Avoid Special Characters:** Stick to alphanumeric characters and hyphens; avoid spaces and special symbols.
- **Consider Brevity:** While being descriptive, try to keep the name reasonably short.

### Organization and Structure

The organization and structure of repositories within the organization should follow these guidelines:

- **Categorize by Topic:** Place repositories within the appropriate topic or category to make navigation easier.
- **Use Subfolders if Necessary:** If needed, further divide repositories into subfolders or subcategories.
- **Maintain Consistency:** Keep the structure consistent across different topics or categories.
- **Collaborate with Maintainers:** If you're unsure about where to place a repository, collaborate with the maintainers or other contributors.

## Conclusion

Adhering to these naming and organization guidelines ensures that the repositories within the organization remain well-organized and easily accessible. This facilitates collaboration and contribution, helping everyone to find what they need quickly.

If you have any questions about these guidelines or need assistance with naming or organizing a repository, please reach out to the maintainers or other experienced contributors.
